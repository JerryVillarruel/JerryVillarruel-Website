        <div class="subheading mb-5">Medical Assistant ðŸ©º</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a healthcare assistant, health professional who helps assist other health professionals.I have the qualifications for the skills, studies, and interest in this desire to work. I am certified in American Heart Association Basic Life Support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), American Heart Association First-Aid, Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Electro Cardio Gram (ECG), and Injections. .<br><br>

        My usual work area is at a clinical space. I tend to do a lot of vital signs as well communicating with patients. The usual work is updating and filling patient medical records, coding and filling out insurance forms, arranging hospital admissions and laboratory services, making appointments, making phone calls, getting patients ready for physicians, and explaining things to them so they can walk out knowing what they need to know. <br><br>

        I started my journey in freshmen year of highschool from getting the basic certifications to shadowing health care providers to having an internship at a clinic. I volunteered at several clinics as well as hospitals trying to observe and gain as much knowledge as I can obtain. This helped me dive in to the medical field more and become a medical assistant. The paste I saw health care professionals work at made me wanna do the same. I had always wanted to be a vet when I was a kid but this opportunity I had with working with humans made me change my mind. I knew I wanted to save lives but I wasn't fully aware of which lives I wanted to save if it was animals or humans. I volunteered at an animal shelter as well but I enjoyed more working with humans.I was certified as a medical assistant my senior year of highschool and that was a huge accomplishment I had done especially at such a young age. I was very independent and did not rely on others because I only had myself at the end of the day. You have to be confident at this job to keep your mind going to boost yourself that you got this. I have to be mentally well in order to help my patients get well. My job is making sure my patients feel comfortable to open up to me so we can find the best treatment and understandment for them as well as them walking out knowing that there health is at best hands. I encourage myself to strive for more and hope to become a doctor or surgeon. As this path takes me in majoring in biology to use this degree to my advantage and going to medical school. The job of any health care provider isn't easy peoples lives depend on you. Thats why this job is so hard because there are so many things that have to be learned so errors or mistakes don't occur. My  time is very valuable and thats why it shouldn't be wasted so I can become successful, its like money its valuable and many of us don't have a lot of it so why waste it.
